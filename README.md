Uses pillow to create a leaderboard of weekly top sellers and their headshots

When I started my job, they gave me the task of updating the leaderboard (manually in a powerpoint file) and I didn't feel like copying a report or clicking through files for headshots, so I learned to use PIL to just make it for me. The following code is similar to how I used it.
